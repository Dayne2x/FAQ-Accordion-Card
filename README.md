## My process

### Built with:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

For this project the special challenge was to try to replicate the component without using JavaScript. I've tried to do that using the details disclosure
element along with some CSS stylings. Mobile version will be added at a future date.


### Continued development

The next project will be replicating the component, including JavaScript in order to get it to a satisfactory responsivnes level as well as a mobile version.
